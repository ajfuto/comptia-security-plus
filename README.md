### ‚ùì What is this?
I'm currently preparing to take my CompTIA Security+ SYO-601 certification exam! During my preparation, I will update this repository with information I find to be helpful for succeeding in Security+.

### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Who am I?
I'm a junior studying Computer Science at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/). I have a background in IT and networking, and I'm transitioning into the broader cybersecurity realm.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Exam Information
CompTIA Security+ is an industry-standard cybersecurity certification for intermediate-level cybersecurity jobs. 

### üö∂ Certification Path
Although not required, I previously passed the CompTIA A+ and CompTIA Network+ exams. CompTIA calls this group of exams (plus the IT Fundamentals+ exam) their *Core Skills Certifications*. These certifications prepare professionals for the CompTIA *Infrastructure Pathway* and *Cybersecurity Pathway*. [[+]](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/which-certification)

### ‚úîÔ∏è Exam Objectives (Domains)
CompTIA Security+ focuses on five major cybersecurity domains. Each domain and the measure to which it is represented in the exam are listed as follows: [[+]](https://www.comptia.org/blog/comptia-security-501-vs-601)

Domain | Percentage of Examination
:-|:-:
Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities | 24%
Architecture and Design | 21%
Implementation | 25%
Operations and Incident Response | 16%
Governance, Risk, and Compliance | 14%

### üìã Exam Structure
* Maximum of 90 questions
* Questions are multiple-choice and performance-based (using simulations of things like firewalls, networks diagrams, or operating systems)
* Passing score is **750** (on a scale of 100-900)

### üìù Resources
As a college student, I focused on finding ***free*** or inexpensive study material. Here are some of my recommendations.
* **Training Material**
	1. [Professor Messer (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8) - I ***love*** Professor Messer's videos! I followed him through Network+ and it only felt natural to do so for Security+ as well. His videos are very digestible and are typically 5-10 minutes each. (You can even listen to his lectures in the background while gaming üòâ.)
	2. [NetworkChuck (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhvC56v63IIyU0aBUed4qwP0nSCORAdB) - NetworkChuck makes very consistently engaging content and his Security+ videos are no different. However, this series is not yet complete and Chuck seems to be taking a hiatus from it... The videos he has up are still worth watching, though!

* **Practice Questions**
	1. [ExamCompass](https://www.examcompass.com/comptia/security-plus-certification/free-security-plus-practice-tests) - ExamCompass provides a ***ton*** of practice questions for Security+. Each of their practice tests seems to have a pretty narrow scope, so be sure to take a handful of them to get a broader coverage of the test.
	2. [Jason Dion (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/security-601-exams/) - I took Jason Dion's practice exams before my Network+ exam and felt like he nailed the test spot on! This is the only paid resource on my list, but I would highly recommend it. It's not very expensive (typically $15-$20 on sale), and Jason runs sales frequently that bring the price down even lower.

* **Other**
	1. [This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/ii1yhn/passed_sec_was_so_ez_i_am_beyond_shocked_here_is/) - u/phabeon documented his entire Security+ (SYO-501) journey and the resources he found helpful. He passed on his first try with **zero prior knowledge or experience in information security**.
	2. [Flash Cards (Quizlet)](https://quizlet.com/139927897/security-flash-cards/) - Everyone loves a good Quizlet.
